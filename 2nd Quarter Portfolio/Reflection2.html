So for 2nd Quarter... I did plenty questionable things but before that, let us tackle the one and only... <b>CSS</b>. Overall it was a rough quarter for me especially the recitation where I had the same question twice in order to get the correct answer. Because of that, I got 3 points without even trying. Although I could've gotten 5, I am thankful for that oppurtunity.

<br>
I also forgot about CSS, but because of this editing code, I was able to make this browser with ease. (Except it is actually a mix of internal and external CSS.) Basically it helped me get this work fast and easy. If I can recall, I did forget what value to use in order to change color with the style attribute. That slowed me down alot. But I am grateful for Ms. Uminga to teach us the ways of technology and coding.

<br>
As for 3rd Quarter, well I'll make sure to understand it very well and clearly. But before that...
